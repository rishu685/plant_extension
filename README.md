# Tab Garden ðŸŒ±

A Chrome extension that transforms your new tab page into a visual garden where each open tab is represented by a plant, encouraging mindful browsing habits.

## Features

- **Visual Tab Representation**: Each open tab becomes a plant in your garden
- **Plant Variety**: Different websites get different plant types (YouTube â†’ Fern, GitHub â†’ Bonsai, etc.)
- **Health System**: Plants stay healthy when you visit them, but start wilting after 24 hours of inactivity
- **Interactive Garden**: Click on plants to switch to their corresponding tabs
- **Real-time Updates**: Your garden updates automatically as you open, close, and visit tabs
- **Beautiful Design**: Animated background and responsive layout with a garden theme

## Plant Types

- ðŸŒ¿ **Fern** - YouTube and video sites
- ðŸŒ³ **Bonsai** - GitHub and development sites  
- ðŸŒ¸ **Flower** - Twitter/X and social media
- ðŸŒµ **Cactus** - News and information sites
- ðŸŒ» **Sunflower** - Google and search engines
- ðŸŒ² **Tree** - Stack Overflow and Q&A sites
- ðŸŽ‹ **Bamboo** - Reddit and forums
- ðŸŒ± **Sapling** - All other websites

## Installation

## How It Works

- **Healthy Plants**: Tabs visited within the last 24 hours appear as healthy, colorful plants

- **Tab Management**: Click any plant to switch to that tab, or right-click to close it

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Esc` - Close the new tab
